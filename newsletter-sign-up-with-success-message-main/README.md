## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

## JavaScript Interaction:

1. Validating form inputs using JavaScript.
2. Displaying error messages for invalid inputs.
3. Showing/hiding elements based on user interaction (success message, error message, etc.).
4. Handling form submission and displaying success messages.

### Continued development

I would like to explore more on DOM manipulation, form validation like doing Real-time validation for instant feedback and also adding reset button. Also working with Client-Side Data Storage, AJAX requests
