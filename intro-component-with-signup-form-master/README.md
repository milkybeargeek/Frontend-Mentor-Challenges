## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwind.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

## HTML Structure

The HTML document provides the backbone of the webpage, with elements like <header>, <main>, and <footer> used to structure content logically.

## Responsive Design

- By utilizing Tailwind CSS classes, I've discovered how to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. The lg: prefix allows for specific styles to be applied to larger screens.

## CSS Styling

- I've used Tailwind CSS utility classes to style elements directly within the HTML, making it easy to apply styles without writing custom CSS. Custom CSS properties are also employed for more specific styling needs.

## Form Handling

- The inclusion of a form with input fields and a submit button demonstrates the basics of form creation. Although not fully implemented, I can see how JavaScript would be used to handle form submissions and perform client-side validation.

## Event Handling

- JavaScript event listeners, such as addEventListener, are employed to respond to user interactions like form submissions and input focus. This allows for the execution of custom functions in response to these events.

## Validation

- I've learned how to perform basic form validation using JavaScript functions. This includes checking for empty input fields and validating email address formats, which enhances the user experience by providing feedback on incorrect data entry.

## Flexbox Layout

- Flexbox is used to create a flexible layout, enabling elements to be easily positioned within containers. This is crucial for achieving responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Continued development

## Enhanced User Interactivity

- I aim to incorporate more interactive elements into the webpage, such as animations, transitions, and dynamic content updates. By leveraging JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js, I can create seamless user experiences that engage and delight visitors.

## Server-Side Processing

- While client-side validation is important for immediate feedback to users, I recognize the need for server-side validation and processing to ensure data integrity and security. I plan to learn more about backend technologies like Node.js and Express.js to handle form submissions and interact with databases.
